# TPodVector<T>

## Overview

This document defines POD vector and typed view utilities implemented
in TPodVector.hpp.

The layer provides contiguous tightly packed storage for trivially
copyable elements. It includes owning vector storage and non-owning
typed views.

The implementation is noexcept. Allocation failure is reported by
return value. Accessors are fail-safe.

## Requirements and scope

- Requires C++17 or later.
- No exceptions are used.
- T must be non-const and trivially copyable.
- Storage is tightly packed contiguous T elements with no
  per-element padding.
- Sizes, capacities, and indices are expressed in elements.

Scope:

- Models contiguous tightly packed element storage only.
- Does not perform construction or destruction.
- Does not support non-trivial relocation semantics.
- Higher-level element meaning belongs in wrapper layers.

## Memory model

Ownership is provided by a relocatable memory::CMemoryToken configured with
stride sizeof(T).

- storage is interpreted as tightly packed T[]
- size() is the logical element count
- capacity() is the allocated element count
- spare capacity is not part of the logical range

## Growth model

Automatic growth uses memory::vector_growth_policy() with the vector's derived
element-count ceiling supplied explicitly.

Operations:

- reserve(minimum_capacity) ensures capacity >= minimum_capacity
- ensure_free(extra) ensures at least extra spare elements
- shrink_to_fit() reduces capacity to match size

reserve() and ensure_free() succeed without allocating or otherwise mutating
the vector when the requested capacity is already satisfied. This includes a
zero request on a canonical empty vector.

## Reallocation model

Reallocation preserves only the logical element range.

- preserved range: [0, size)
- shrinking truncates to new size
- spare capacity contents are not preserved
- storage beyond logical range is uninitialised
- newly exposed elements may be zeroed where required

## Alignment model

- storage is tightly packed T[] with stride sizeof(T)
- alignment is derived from T via t_default_align<T>()
- alignment is not configurable per instance

## Observation model

- accessors are fail-safe
- observers reflect container invariants
- size == 0 reports empty even if capacity != 0
- size == 0, capacity != 0 is a valid ready state

## Typed storage invariants

Canonical empty:

    data == nullptr
    size == 0
    capacity == 0

Valid:

    data != nullptr
    size <= capacity
    capacity != 0
    storage is tightly packed T[]
    alignment is sufficient for T

## Initialisation model

- resize(size) grows logical range and zeroes new elements
- push_back_zeroed / insert_zeroed expose zeroed storage
- push_back_uninit / insert_uninit expose uninitialised storage
- reserve / ensure_free may grow capacity without changing size

Zeroed growth is byte-zeroing only.

## Removal model

- pop_back() copies removed elements to a destination
- pop_back_preserve_order() preserves their logical order in the destination
- discard_back() removes elements without copying them to a destination
- try_discard_back() removes up to the requested count and reports the count
  removed
- discard_back(0) succeeds without changing the vector

## Range operation model

For boolean pointer-count operations:

- a zero count succeeds without requiring allocated storage and does not
  inspect the pointer
- a non-zero count requires a non-null pointer
- a non-zero source or destination within the vector's own backing allocation
  is rejected

View overloads additionally require a valid view. Because zero-length views are
invalid by contract, passing one fails rather than acting as a raw zero-count
operation.

## Copy and representation model

- element transfer uses byte-wise copy or move
- padding bytes may be propagated
- byte-level equality is not guaranteed for semantically equal values
